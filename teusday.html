	<p>As study became better documented, it was come to be known that the ocean Seavanna was the creatures home, and in fact, many other marvelous creatures lived in this ecological wonders. The ocean fauna here all share an innate ability to breath both on land and in the water. It is theorized that the land here had flooded as sea levels rose, and the creatures, and even the landscape, adapted. Full lush trees grow under the water, and the animals carried on living as though nothing had changed. </p>
