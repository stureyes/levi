<p>Here is a preview clip of the recently released documentary, which contains incredible, never beforeseen footage of Levi the Lionfish in its natural habitat.</p>

<p>Creating this animation was done primarily using several different programs. Assets were illustrated in Clip Studio Paint, edited in Photoshop, and then the assets were pinned together and animated using After Effects. Once I had the storyboard down, and I understood what movements/motions were going to be needed, I illustrated each asset separately, so each leg was drawn independent from the body, so that it could all be put together and animated properly. Once in After Effects, use of puppet pins was used generously to create a smooth, swimming animation loop. As well as to create that ocean-like, wavey effect in the seaweed that flows through the animation. The background and the bubbles share the same asset, which was kind of a happy accident I stumbled into, because using the background asset for the bubbles gave it that gradient effect so it looks like the bubbles change color as they rise. There is a cut in the middle of this animation, which were both rendered from their own project file, and edited together into a single file along with the audio, part of which I  recorded on my phone, and the ambiance background audio was  sourced from user akemoy from  Freesound.
